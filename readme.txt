Team details:
                  NAME                   USN
               -Kiran v dambal        1KS18CS033

Contribution of team members:-

   we have given our best to write the efficent code for a provided question(Asn02P12),
   that is,
	-Kiran,
	  hlped to understand and explained the concept "Binary insertion sort",given the idea to apply 
	  the recursion function conept, helped to apply the commad line arguments which is instruction 
	  to run the program, helped in debugging and tracing the code. 
	-Maharaj, 
	  hepled to analyze the code for its working , helped to understand time complexity of program
	  by explaining it briefly, helped in debugging of errors during compilation of the code, helped 
	  by tracing the code for perfect output. 

Instructions to run the program:-

	We have used command line arguments in this program, for efficent execution off program . And with 
	the halp of command line arguments we can run our program in the CMD just by typing the file name 
	and inputs saperated by space. 
			
		Eg:-
		     filename	input
		     asn02P12    6 7 3 9 0 1 5 2 8 4

Detils on example invocation and output:-

	Binery insertion sort uses Binary rearch to find the appropriate position to insert A[i] among the 
        previously sorted A[0],A[1]......A[i-1] .
	
	 For example  	
               input :- 6 7 3 9 0 1 5 2 8 4
          then
	       output :-
		the sorted array is 
		0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 	

Challenges faced:-

	Initially, we were not able to understand the question and concept mentioned in the question then,
	we mailed our quarries to sir . with the explination in reply to our mail hapled to understand the 
	queation, then we were aware of what to do. 
	Later on , with our continious effort and team cordination we wrote the efficent code for required
	solution. but still we had some errors which were debuged later by tracing the code.  
	finaly by our team cordination and hard work we sucesfully creted the efficent program.

Things we learnt from our assignment:-

	This assignment helped us to understand the concepts like 
	 -Binary insertion sort.
	 -Time complexity.
	 -Space complrxity.
	 -Recursion function.
	 -Command line argument.
